# 🚀 ResilientAI Development Roadmap

This roadmap outlines the planned development milestones for **ResilientAI** — an AI-powered early warning system designed to predict and mitigate flood disasters in vulnerable regions across Africa.

---

## 📍 Phase 1 – Prototype (Current)
- Finalize system architecture and data ingestion pipeline.
- Develop baseline machine learning model for flood prediction.
- Create initial dashboard wireframes and SMS/USSD alert templates.
- Build foundational GitHub repository and documentation.

---

## 📈 Phase 2 – MVP (Next 2–3 Months)
- Implement complete data processing and prediction pipeline.
- Train and validate flood risk prediction models with historical and real-time data.
- Develop working dashboard and basic alert delivery system.
- Test prototype with sample data from Maiduguri and Lake Chad Basin.

---

## 🌐 Phase 3 – Pilot Deployment (3–6 Months)
- Integrate live weather, satellite, and hydrological data sources.
- Partner with telecom providers for real SMS/USSD delivery.
- Collaborate with government agencies (NiMet, NEMA, Borno SEMA) and NGOs for pilot testing.
- Deploy pilot version for real-world testing in Maiduguri and surrounding areas.

---

## 🌍 Phase 4 – Scaling & Expansion (6–12 Months)
- Expand solution to additional flood-prone regions (Benue, Bayelsa, Lagos).
- Introduce analytics reports and third-party API access.
- Add multi-language support, offline features, and community training tools.
- Build partnerships for cross-border early warning systems across West Africa.

---

## 🚀 Long-Term Vision (12+ Months)
- Establish ResilientAI as a continental early-warning platform.
- Integrate with broader climate resilience networks and disaster-response platforms.
- Offer predictive insights for other climate risks (drought, heatwaves, etc.)
